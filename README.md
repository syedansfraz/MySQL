## ðŸ“˜ SQL-Only Projects â€“ E-Commerce & Library Management Systems

This repository contains my **initial learning projects** built using **pure MySQL**, with no frontend or backend code.

These beginner-to-intermediate level projects helped me practice:

- âœ… Real-world database schema design  
- âœ… Data normalization techniques  
- âœ… Writing **Triggers**, **Stored Procedures**, and **Views**  
- âœ… Performing **reporting and analytical SQL queries**

These projects are designed to **build core SQL and database design skills**, and serve as a strong foundation for future **full-stack development** or backend-focused applications.
